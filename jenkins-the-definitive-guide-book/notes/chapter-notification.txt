# Monitoring your build jobs

## Introduction

The fine art of notification

## Email notification 
	- Easy to ignore
	- Necessary
	
Email notification is the most obvious and most common form of CI notification. Email is well-known, ubiquitous, easy to use and easy to configure (see sect-configuration-email).

You activate email notification in Hudson by ticking the 'E-mail Notification' checkbox and providing the list of email addresses of the people who need to be notified. By default, Hudson will send an email for every failed or unstable build. Remember, It will also send a new email for the first successful build after a series of failed or unstable builds, to indicate that the issue has been fixed. 

Normally a build should not take took many tries to get working again - developers should diagnose and reproduce the issue locally, fix it locally, and only then commit their fix to version control. Repeated build failures usually indicate either a chronic configuration issue or poor developer practices (developers committing changes without checking that it works locally first). 

You can also opt to send a separate email to any developers who have committed changes to the broken build. This is generally a good idea, as developers who have committed changes since the last build are naturally the people who should be the most interested in the build results. Hudson will get the email address of the user from the currently-configured security realm (see sect-security-realms), or by deriving the email address from the SCM username if you have set this up (see sect-configuration-email). 

If you use this option, it may be less useful to include the entire team in the main distribution list. You may want to simply include people who will interested in monitoring the result of every build (such as technical leads), and let Hudson inform contributing developers directly.

This assumes of course that the changes caused the build failure, which is generally (but not always) the case. However, if the builds are infrequent (for example, nightly builds, or if a build is queued for several hours before finally kicking off), many changes may have been committed, and it is hard to know which one was actually responsible for the build failure. 

Not all builds are alike when it comes to email notification. Developers committing changes are particularly interested in the results of the unit and integration test builds (especially those triggered by their own changes), whereas BAs and testers might be more interested in keeping tabs on the status of the automated acceptance tests. So the exact email notification setup for each build job will be different. In fact, it is useful to define an email notification strategy. An example of an email notification strategy is outlined here:
	- fast build (unit/integration tests, runs in less than 5 minutes): team lead and contributors
	- acceptance tests builds (run after the fast builds): team lead, testers and contributors
	- nightly builds (QA metrics, only run if the other builds work): all team members - provide a snapshot picture of project health before the daily status meeting.

By default, Hudson email notification is a rather blunt tool. Notification messages are always sent to basically the same group of people. You cannot send messages to different people depending on what went wrong, or implement any sort of escalation policy. It would be useful, for example, to be able to notify the developers who committed changes the first time a build breaks, and send a different message to the team lead or the entire team if the build breaks a second time.

The 'Email-ext plugin' lets you define a more refined email notification strategy. You can fine-tune the contents of the email message, and also define a more precise notification strategy with different messages and recipient lists for different events. This plugin is designed to replace the standard Hudson email notification - once you install and configure it, you can deactivate the normal 'E-mail Notification' configuration.

The notification strategy used by this plugin is based on the concept of triggers. 
- Configuring triggers
- Different recipient lists for different events
-  

- Customizing the email messages
- Using tokens

However, as a notification strategy, email is not without its faults.

Some developers shut down their email clients at times to avoid being interrupted. In large organizations, the number of email messages arriving each day can be considerable, and build failure notifications can be hidden among a host of other less important messages. So build failures may not always get the high-priority attention they require in a finely-tuned CI environment. In the following sections, we will look at some other notification strategies that can be used to raise team awareness of failed builds and encourage developers to get them fixed faster.

	
When a build does fail, it can be useful to know that someone has spotted the issue and is working on it. The Clai

## Build Radiators

The concept of information radiators is commonly used in Agile circles. According to Agile guru Alistair Cockburn:
"An Information radiator is a display posted in a place where people can see it as they work or walk by. It shows readers information they care about without having to ask anyone a question. This means more communication with fewer interruptions."

In the context of a CI server, an information radiator is a prominent device or display that allows team members and others to easily see if any builds are currently broken. It typically shows either a summary of all the current build results, or of just the failing ones, and is displayed on a large, prominently located wall mounted flat screen. This sort of specialized information radiator is often known as a 'build radiator'. 

When used well, build radiators are among the most effective of the passive notification strategies. A build radiator raises awareness . Unlike some of the Extreme Feedback Devices that we discuss later on in this chapter, a build radiator can cater for many build jobs, including many failing build jobs, and so can still be effectively used in a multi-team context.

There are several build radiator solutions for Hudson. One of the easiest to use is the 'Hudson Radiator View Plugin'

Since the build radiator view takes up the entire screen, modifying or deleting a build radiator is a bit tricky.

Another similar plugin is the 'eXtreme Feedback Panel Plugin'. 

Another approach is to use a separate application to publish your build results.

## Instant Messaging
	- Useful if they are used in the org
	
## The build radiator - transparent build results

## Desktop notifiers - hard to ignore

## Instant Messaging

First, you need to install both the Hudson instant-messaging plugin and the Hudson Jabber notifier plugin in the plugin manager page and restart hudson (see fig-email-notification-jabber-plugins)

email-notification-jabber-plugins

Once this is done, you need to configure your Instant Messaging server. Any Jabber server will do. You can use a public service like Google Chat, or set up your own internal Jabber server (the open source chat server OpenFire (http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/index.jsp) is a good choice). However, using a public service for internal communications may be frowned upon by system administrators, and may have difficulty getting through corporate firewalls. Setting up your own internal chat service, on the other hand, makes great sense for a development team or organization in general, as it provides another channel of communication that works well for technical questions or comments between developers. The following examples will be using a local OpenFire server, but the general approach will work for any Jabber-compatible server.

First of all, you need to create a dedicated account on your Jabber server for Hudson. This is just an ordinary chat account, but it needs to be distinct from your developer accounts.


First of all, you define a recipient list for the messages. You can send messages to individuals (just use the corresponding Jabber ID, such as joe@jabber.acme.com) or to chat rooms that you have set up. For chat rooms, you normally need to add a '*' to the start of the chat room ID (e.g. '*gameoflife@conference.jabber.acme.org'). However, if the chat room ID contains '@conference.', Hudson will work out that it is a chat room and append the '*' automatically. The chat room approach is more flexible, though you do have to trust developers to be connected permanently to the chat room for this strategy to be truly effective.

You can get a full list of commands by sending the "!help" message to the Hudson user. Some examples of a few of the more useful commands are shown here:

build
	!build game-of-life - Start the game-of-life build immediately
	!build game-of-life 15m - Start the game-of-life build in 15 minutes 

	!comment game-of-life 207 'oops' - add a build description to a given build
	
	!status game-of-life - display the status of the latest build for this build job
	
	!testresult game-of-life - display the full test results for the latest build
	!health game-of-life - display a more complete summary of the health status of the latest build

abort <job> - specify which job to abort
alias [<alias> [<command>]] - defines a new alias, deletes one or lists all existing aliases
botsnack [<snack>] - om nom nom
build <job> [now|<delay>[s|m|h]] [<parameterkey>=<value>]* - schedule a job build, with standard, custom or no quiet period

http://notifo.com/service/console_subscribe
-----------

Notifo (notifo.com) is a very economical service to send real-time notifications to your smart phone or desktop. In the context of a Hudson server, you can use it to set up real-time notification for your Hudson build results (check the Notifo web site for details of their pricing plan, but at the time of writing up to 10,000 notifications per month were free). One of the strong points of a real-time notification service like Notifo is that notification messages can be sent to the same users on different devices: smart phones and desk top clients, in particular.

Setting up Hudson notification with Notifo is relatively straightforward. First, go to the Notifio web site and sign up to create an account. Each team member who wants to be notified will need their own Notifo account. They will also need to install the Notifo client on each device on which they need to receive notification messages. At the time of writing, Notifo clients were available for Windows and Mac OS X desktops, and iPhones, with support for Linux and other smart phones on the way.

Next, you need to set up a Notifo service account for your Hudson server. You can do this with one of your developer accounts, or create a new account for the purpose. Log on to the Notifo web site, and go to the 'My Services' menu (http://notifo.com/user/my_services). Here, click on 'Create Service' (see figure 'hudson-notification-notifo-create-service'), and fill in the fields. The most important is the Service Username, which needs to be unique. You can also specify the Site URL and the Default Notification URL to point to your Hudson instance, so that users can open the Hudson console by clicking on the notification message.

To receive notification messages from the Hudson server, developers now need to subscribe to this service. You can then add developers to the list of subscribers in the service 'Subscribers' page, by sending them subscription requests. 

Once the service has been created and the users are all subscribed, you can configure your project to send out Notifo notifications. You need the provide the API username of the Hudson service you set up, as well as the API Secret, both of which you can see in the Notifo Service Dashboard. At the time of writing, sophisticated notification strategies are not supported - you just provide a list of Notifo usernames who need to be notified. Nevertheless, this remains a very effective notification tool for front-line developers.
