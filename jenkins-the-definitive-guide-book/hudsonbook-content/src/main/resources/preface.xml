  <section>
    <title>Audience</title>

    <para>This book is aimed at relatively technical readers, though no
    prior experience with Continuous Integration is assumed. You may be new to
    Continuous Integration, and would like to learn about the benefits it can
    bring to your development team. Or, you might be using Jenkins or Hudson
    already, and want to discover how you can take your Continuous Integration
    infrastructure further.</para>

    <para>Much of the book discusses Jenkins in the context of Java or
    JVM-based projects. Nevertheless, even if you're using another
    technology stack, this book should give you a good grounding in Continuous
    Integration with Jenkins. We discuss how to build projects using several
    non-Java technologies, including Grails, Ruby on Rails, and .NET. In
    addition, many topics, such as general configuration, notification,
    distributed builds, and security are applicable no matter what language you
    use.</para>

    <title>Book layout</title>

    <para>Continuous Integration is like a lot of things: the more you put in,
    the more value you will get out. While even aÂ  basic Continuous
    Integration setup will produce positive improvements in your team process,
    there are significant advantages to gradually assimilating and
    implementing some of the more advanced techniques as well. To this end,
    this book is organized as a progressive trek into the world of Continuous
    Integration with Jenkins, starting from simple and going to more advanced. In the first
    chapter, we start off with a sweeping overview of what Jenkins is all
    about, in the form of a high level guided tour. From there, we progress
    into how to install and configure your Jenkins server and how to set up
    basic build jobs. Once you've mastered the basics, we'll delve into
    more advanced topics, including automated testing practices, security,
    more advanced notification techniques, and measuring and reporting on code
    quality metrics. Next, we move on to more advanced build techniques such
    as matrix builds, distributed builds, and cloud-based CI, before discussing
    how to implement Continuous Deployment with Jenkins. Finally, we cover
    some tips on maintaining your Jenkins server.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Jenkins or Hudson?</title>

    <para>As we discuss in the introduction, Jenkins was originally, and up
    until recently, known as Hudson. In 2009, Oracle purchased Sun and
    inherited the Hudson code base. In early 2011, tensions between Oracle
    and the open source community reached a rupture point and the project forked
    into two separate entities: Jenkins, run by most of the original Hudson
    developers, and Hudson, which remained under the control of Oracle.</para>

    <para>As the title suggests, this book is primarily focused on Jenkins.
    However, much of the book was initially written before the fork, and the
    products remain very similar. So, although the examples and illustrations
    do usually refer to Jenkins, almost all of what is discussed will also
    apply to Hudson.</para>

    <title>Command-line conventions</title>

    <para>From time to time, this book describes command-line instructions.
    Output appearing on the console (e.g. command prompts or screen
    output) is displayed in normal characters, and commands (what you type)
    are written in <command>bold</command>. For example: <screen>$ <command>ls -al</command>

    <para>Where necessary, the backslash character at the end of the line is
    used to indicate a line-break: you can type this all on one line (without
    the backslash) if you prefer. Don't forget to ignore the '&gt;' character
    at the start of any subsequent lines - it's a unix prompt
    character:<screen>$ <command>wget -O - http://jenkins-ci.org/debian/jenkins-ci.org.key \
</command>&gt; <command>| sudo apt-key add -</command></screen>For
    consistency, unless we are discussing a Windows-specific issue, we'll
    use Unix-style command prompts (the dollar sign, '$'), as shown
    here:</para>

    <para><screen>$ <command>java -jar jenkins.war</command></screen></para>

    <para>or</para>

    <para><screen>$ <command>svn list svn://localhost</command></screen></para>

    <para>However, unless we say otherwise, Windows users can safely use these
    commands from the Windows command console:<screen>C:\Documents and Settings\Owner&gt; <command>java -jar jenkins.war</command></screen></para>

    <para>or</para>

    <title>The review team</title>

    <para>The technical review process for this book was a little different than
    the approach taken for most books. Rather than having one or two technical
    reviewers read the entire book near the end of the book-writing process, a
    team of volunteers from the Jenkins community, including many key Jenkins
    developers, were able to read chapters as they were written. This review
    team was made up of the following people: Alan Harder, Andrew Bayer, Carlo
    Bonamico, Chris Graham, Eric Smalling, Gregory Boissinot, Harald Soevik,
    Julien Simpson, Juven Xu, Kohsuke Kawaguchi, Martijn Verberg, Ross Rowe,
    and Tyler Ballance.</para>
